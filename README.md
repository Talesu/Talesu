### ü§µ About Me:
- Hi, I'm Talesu.
- I'm a 22-year-old developer from the Netherlands.
- I lead UnixMC (also known as UnixLabs), a global, volunteer-driven game studio.
- Our mission is to create an exploit-free gaming experience that prioritizes player enjoyment over profit.
- This vision has been a lifelong passion of mine, inspired by a childhood dream of setting up a Minecraft Project to fill what I felt was missing in the gaming world.
- I balance university, work, and other projects by structuring my day into focused creative sessions and manager days.
- This approach helps me dive deep into technical work while nurturing a collaborative environment where team leads make decisions and everyone contributes.
- Leading UnixMC has been incredibly rewarding, as I watch passionate volunteers work towards a bigger goal, make new friends, and hone my leadership, communication, and management skills.
- As we prepare to release our beta version and step into the spotlight with a minimum viable product, I‚Äôm more determined than ever to bring this vision to life.
